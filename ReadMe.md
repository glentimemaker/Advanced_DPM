## Implementation of Vehicular Camera Sensors in V2V Platform ##

This project is to effectively assist drivers so as to reduce the number of traffic accidents is a challenge issue in transportation engineering.
•Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication platform
exchange GPS positions, speed and other data between nearby connected vehicles
•Enhance V2V-equipped vehicles with visual sensors
access the traffic statuses of isolated vehicles, provide rich imagery descriptions of the surrounding environments of the host vehicles.

We are trying to develop an advanced DPM algorithm to get a better performance of detecting the vehicle.
